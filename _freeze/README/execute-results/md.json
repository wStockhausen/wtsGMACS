To avoid error messages when installing \nthe packages, install them in the reverse order listed above.\n\nOther required packages available on CRAN include:\n\n  * dplyr\n  * ggplot2 \n  * graphics \n  * magrittr \n  * RColorBrewer \n  * readr \n  * reshape2 \n  * stats \n  * tibble \n  * tidyr\n\n## How to use \n\nThe `runGMACS` function can be used to run a GMACS model, as in:\n\n```\nwtsGMACS::runGMACS(runpath=path_to_run_folder,\n                   runCmds= list(path2exe=path_to_exe,\n                                 path2dat=path_to_gmacs_dat_file);\n````\nIn the above, `path_to_run_folder` is a path (absolute or relative to the R working directory) to the folder \nin which you want the model to run, `path_to_exe` is a path to \nthe gmacs executable, and `path_to_gmacs_dat_file` is a path to the `gmacs.dat` file describing \nthe model run, \n\nUse `?wtsGMACS::runGMACS` for more information.\n\nThe `runJitter` function can be used to evaluate a series of model runs under parameter \njittering. Use `?wtsGMACS::runJitter` for more information.\n\nThe `readModelResults` function can be used to read results from the `par`, `std`, \n`Gmacsall.std`, and `gmacs.rep1` files for multiple model runs:\n\n```\nfldrs_ = c(A=path_to_ModelResultsA,\n           B=path_to_ModelResultsB);\nMs = wtsGMACS::readModelResults(fldrs_);\n```\n\nwhere `fldrs_` is a named character vector (the names will be used as model names in the \nresults list) and the `path_`'s are paths to the model run folders of interest. `Ms` will be a \n`gmacs_reslst` object (a list with of class \"gmacs_reslst\") that encompasses results from \nall the models of interest.\n\nUse `?wtsGMACS::readModelResults` for more information.\n\n****************************\n\n## NOAA Disclaimer\n\nThis repository is a scientific product and is not official communication of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or the United States Department of Commerce.
