To avoid error messages when installing the packages, install them in the reverse order listed above.\nOther required packages available on CRAN include:\n\ndplyr\nggplot2\ngraphics\nmagrittr\nRColorBrewer\nreadr\nreshape2\nstats\ntibble\ntidyr\n\n\n\n\n\nThe runGMACS function can be used to run a GMACS model, as in:\nwtsGMACS::runGMACS(runpath=path_to_run_folder,\n                   runCmds= list(path2exe=path_to_exe,\n                                 path2dat=path_to_gmacs_dat_file);\nIn the above, path_to_run_folder is a path (absolute or relative to the R working directory) to the folder in which you want the model to run, path_to_exe is a path to the gmacs executable, and path_to_gmacs_dat_file is a path to the gmacs.dat file describing the model run,\nUse ?wtsGMACS::runGMACS for more information.\nThe runJitter function can be used to evaluate a series of model runs under parameter jittering. Use ?wtsGMACS::runJitter for more information.\nThe readModelResults function can be used to read results from the par, std, Gmacsall.std, and gmacs.rep1 files for multiple model runs:\nfldrs_ = c(A=path_to_ModelResultsA,\n           B=path_to_ModelResultsB);\nMs = wtsGMACS::readModelResults(fldrs_);\nwhere fldrs_ is a named character vector (the names will be used as model names in the results list) and the path_’s are paths to the model run folders of interest.
